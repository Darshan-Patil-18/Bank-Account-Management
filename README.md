# 🏦 Bank Account Management System (Python)

A beginner-level Python project that simulates basic bank account operations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This project is designed to help understand how real-world banking logic can be implemented using simple Python concepts.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Bank Account Management System is a console-based Python application that allows a user to perform common banking operations such as depositing money, withdrawing money, checking the current balance, and viewing transaction history. The program follows a menu-driven approach and ensures proper input validation to prevent invalid transactions.

This project focuses on learning and applying Object-Oriented Programming by representing a bank account as a class and implementing different operations as class methods. It is suitable for beginners who want hands-on practice with Python fundamentals and real-world logic building.
